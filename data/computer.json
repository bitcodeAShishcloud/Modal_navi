    {
      "question": "What is an algorithm?",
      "answer": "An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or completing a task. In computing, algorithms are sets of instructions that tell a computer how to transform input data into desired output. They are fundamental to all aspects of computer science."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between RAM and ROM?",
      "answer": "RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory that temporarily stores data and programs while the computer is running. It's fast but loses all data when power is off. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that permanently stores instructions for booting up the computer and doesn't lose data when powered off."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is object-oriented programming?",
      "answer": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Popular OOP languages include Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a database?",
      "answer": "A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It's typically controlled by a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases allow efficient storage, retrieval, updating, and management of data. Common types include relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is binary code?",
      "answer": "Binary code is the most fundamental form of computer data, consisting of only two digits: 0 and 1 (bits). Computers use binary because digital circuits have two states: on (1) and off (0). All data in computers—numbers, text, images, videos—is ultimately represented as sequences of binary digits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?",
      "answer": "A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code all at once before execution, creating an executable file. It's faster during runtime. An interpreter translates and executes code line by line during runtime. It's slower but provides immediate feedback and easier debugging. C++ uses compilers, Python uses interpreters (though modern implementations use both)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cloud computing?",
      "answer": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics) over the internet ('the cloud'). Instead of owning physical data centers, users can rent access to resources on demand. Major providers include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Benefits include scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an API?",
      "answer": "API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs enable developers to integrate external services into their applications without knowing the internal implementation details."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is machine learning?",
      "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions. Types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications range from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?",
      "answer": "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web, but data is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds encryption through SSL/TLS protocols, ensuring that data transmitted between browsers and servers is encrypted and secure. HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a data structure?",
      "answer": "A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for algorithm efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is version control?",
      "answer": "Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It's essential for collaborative development, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts. Git is the most popular version control system, often used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is recursion?",
      "answer": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Each recursive call works on a smaller version of the problem until reaching a base case that stops the recursion. Classic examples include calculating factorials, traversing trees, and solving the Tower of Hanoi."
